# Pwn 100
Description:
```markdown
One of the hallmarks of binary application security is **address randomization** - hard to use code if you don't know where the code's memory address! However, oftentimes, if you know the address of *one thing* in memory, you can figure out what the addresses of *other things* are. That's the point of this challenge.

I also provide the source code for `pwn100.c` so you can see what's being run remotely.

`nc pwn100.youcanhack.me 1337`

[pwn100.c] [libc.so.6]
```

## Writeup
Here, the participants need to find the difference (in bytes) between `puts()` and `system()`. This can be done a variety of ways, from using `objdump` to Ghidra to GDB to pwntools. I've implemented it in `solve.py`, and it finds that the difference is `0x2f490` for the provided `libc.so.6` file. Then, all they need to do is take the provided `puts()` address, subtract `0x2f490`, and type the answer in `0x...` format to get the flag. 

Example:
```
user@computer$ nc localhost 1337
Welcome to the pwn100 challenge!
The current memory address of puts() is 0x7fba48c62bd0
What's the current memory address of system()? Provide your answer like 0x12345678
> 0x7fba48c33740
Congrats! Here is your flag:
HC{...}
```

**Flag** - `HC{4ddres5_sp4ce_lay0u7_r4nd0m1z4t10n}`

## Hosting
`pwn100` was compiled with the command `gcc -o pwn100 pwn100.c`.

This challenge should be a Docker container that runs `pwn100` on port 1337. All the proper files are included in here. The command to build the docker container is (when located inside of this directory):

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

To stop the challenge:
```bash
docker compose down
```

# Pwn2
Description:
```markdown
Here's another pwn challenge! Let's see if you can run your own assembly!

`nc <ip> <port>`

[pwn2.zip]
```

## Writeup
This challenge involves using shellcode to pop a shell. A stack leak (the exact address of the input buffer actually) is given, and then an overflow allows you to set `$rip` to the start of the shellcode. The shellcode must fit in 64 bytes, which is enough for most online snippets. The solve is automated in `solve.py`.

**Flag** - `byuctf{$10_says_this_one_is_harder_than_pwn3}`

## Hosting
`pwn2` was compiled with the command `gcc -fno-stack-protector -z execstack -o src/pwn2 pwn2.c`.

This challenge should be a Docker container that runs the binary `pwn2` on port 40000 each time someone connects. All the proper files are included in here. The command to build and run the docker container is (when located inside of this directory):

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

To stop the challenge:
```bash
docker compose down
```

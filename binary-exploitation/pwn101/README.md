# Pwn 101
Description:
```markdown
Ever gotten into binary exploitation? If not, then here's your chance! You get to learn how to exploit a buffer overflow!

*Hint: if you're looking for a nice way to interact with the process/remote server using a scripting language, [check out Python pwntools](https://corgi.rip/posts/pwntools-cheatsheet/)!*

`nc pwn101.youcanhack.me 1337`

[pwn101] [pwn101.c]
```

## Writeup
This problem requires using the technique "ret2win", the most basic overflow exploit development technique out there. The `read()` function puts up to 0x40 bytes into a buffer of size 0x30, leaving a 16-byte overflow. You will need to send in 0x38 bytes of padding (to fill the buffer and stored `$rbp` pointer), then the address of the `win()` function. `win()` is located at `0x4011c9`, meaning you'll need to send the raw bytes `\xc9\x11\x40\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00`. 

I scripted it in Python (see `solve.py`), but you can also use `printf` to write the payload to a file and pipe that in as the input to the netcat session (see `solve.sh`).

**Flag** - `HC{th1s_1s_c4ll3d_r3t2w1n}`

## Hosting
`pwn101` was compiled with the command `gcc -o pwn101 -no-pie pwn101.c`.

This challenge should be a Docker container that runs `pwn101` on port 1337. All the proper files are included in here. The command to build the docker container is (when located inside of this directory):

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

To stop the challenge:
```bash
docker compose down
```

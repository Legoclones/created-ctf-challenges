Description:
```markdown
What's the difference (in bytes, hexadecimal format) between the address of the PLT entry and the address of the GOT entry for the `puts()` function?

Flag format - `byuctf{0x????}`

```

## Writeup
The purpose of this very easy pwn problem is to introduce them to GOT and PLT entries, and have them calculate offsets using a given binary. The solve is automated using pwntools in `solve.py`.

**Flag** - `byuctf{0x2fd0}` or `byuctf{-0x2fd0}`

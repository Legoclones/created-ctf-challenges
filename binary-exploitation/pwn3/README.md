# Pwn3
Description:
```markdown
Third time's the charm, right??

`nc <ip> <port>`

[pwn3.zip]
```

## Writeup
This challenge requires you to use ROP to do ret2system, where you put the address for `"/bin/sh"` into the `$rdi` register, then call `system()` and get a shell. This is scripted in `solve.py`.

**Flag** - `byuctf{your_future_looks_bright_young_padawan!}`

## Hosting
`pwn3` was compiled with the command `gcc -fno-stack-protector -no-pie -o src/pwn3 pwn3.c`.

This challenge should be a Docker container that runs the binary `pwn3` on port 40000 each time someone connects. All the proper files are included in here. The command to build and run the docker container is (when located inside of this directory):

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

To stop the challenge:
```bash
docker compose down
```

# Pwn1
Description:
```markdown
If you've been too scared to learn how to exploit buffer overflows, now is your time!!

`nc <ip> <port>`

[pwn1.zip]
```

## Writeup
This is a simple ret2win challenge - 0x38 bytes of padding (0x30 from the buffer, 8 for registers) + the address for the `win()` function to overwrite `$rip`. This is scripted in `solve.py`.

**Flag** - `byuctf{if_this_is_your_jam_you_should_consider_taking_VERE_ðŸ‘€}`

## Hosting
`pwn1` was compiled with the command `gcc -fno-stack-protector -no-pie -o src/pwn1 pwn1.c`.

This challenge should be a Docker container that runs the binary `pwn1` on port 40000 each time someone connects. All the proper files are included in here. The command to build and run the docker container is (when located inside of this directory):

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

To stop the challenge:
```bash
docker compose down
```

# Gorl
Description:
```markdown
Gorl, you BETTER gimme some of dat code!

`nc localhost 1337`

[gorl.zip]
```

## Writeup
This challenge requires you to send in raw bytes that are interpreted as shellcode (or x86 assembly). You can only send up to 32 bytes, but other than that the only requirement is that the 5th byte is set to `NOP`. This is an attempt to teach you how to make your own assembly shellcode, not just using shellcode people have already put on the Internet.

## Hosting
`gorl` was compiled with the command `gcc -o gorl -fstack-protector-all gorl.c`.

This challenge should be a Docker container that runs `gorl` on port 1337. All the proper files are included in here. The command to build the docker container is (when located inside of this directory):

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

To stop the challenge:
```bash
docker compose down
```

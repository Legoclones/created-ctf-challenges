# Goal
Description:
```markdown
Can you reach the `goal()` function?

`nc localhost 1337`

[goal.zip]
```

Hint (if you want) - `google "pwn stack alignment"`

## Writeup
This is a ret2win problem that requires dealing with stack alignment issues. In my solve, I just returned to `goal()+1`, but you can also make a ROP chain with a single `ret` gadget in front. See `solve.py`.

**Flag** - `byuctf{SIUUUUUUUUUUU!!}`

## Hosting
`goal` was compiled with the command `gcc -o goal -no-pie goal.c`.

This challenge should be a Docker container that runs `goal` on port 1337. All the proper files are included in here. The command to build the docker container is (when located inside of this directory):

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

To stop the challenge:
```bash
docker compose down
```

I have fixed all my previous mistakes, so there's no way you'll be able to see my flags!

## Writeup
The flag and the highlight are close in color, but not quite the same (highlight #000000, and flag is #060606). Modifying the contrast in the photo to extreme levels will reveal the pixels of the flag.
